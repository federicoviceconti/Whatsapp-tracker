### Filter method ###
The *filterBy* method could is called when you want to filter your log. You can use multiple filter or single one <br />
An example of filtering by name:
``` 
const stringName = 'Myname';
const orderBoolean = true;
filterBy(['name'], stringName, orderBoolean); 
```
Get all logged messages:
``` 
const orderBoolean = false;
filterBy(['all'], '', orderBoolean); 
```

Possible ordering are present in the **filterArray variable**.
